The error `relation "products" does not exist` means that the `products` table hasn't been created yet in your database.

To resolve this, you need to create the `products` table in your PostgreSQL database before trying to insert any data into it.

### Step 1: Create the `products` Table

Here is the SQL statement to create the `products` table as described in your previous messages:

```sql
-- Create the 'status' enum type if it doesn't already exist
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_type WHERE typname = 'status') THEN
        CREATE TYPE status AS ENUM ('active', 'inactive', 'archived');
    END IF;
END $$;

-- Create the 'products' table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,          -- Auto-incrementing product ID
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,         -- URL of the product's image
  name TEXT NOT NULL,              -- Name of the product
  status status NOT NULL,          -- Product status ('active', 'inactive', 'archived')
  price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,   -- Product price with two decimal places
  stock INTEGER NOT NULL,          -- Number of items in stock
  available_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL  -- Timestamp when the product becomes available
);
```

### Step 2: Verify Table Creation
Run the above SQL commands to ensure the `products` table is created correctly. You can verify the table by listing all tables in the current schema with the following SQL command:

```sql
\dt
```

This should show the `products` table in the list of relations.

### Step 3: Insert Products

After the `products` table is created, you can insert data into the table using SQL, like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (image_url, name, status, price, stock, available_at) 
VALUES (
  'https://example.com/image.png', -- image_url
  'Sample Product',                -- name
  'active',                        -- status
  29.99,                           -- price
  100,                             -- stock
  NOW()                            -- available_at
);
```

### Step 4: Seed Products via API (Optional)

If you have an API for inserting products, make sure that the API connects to the database and the `products` table exists before sending any requests.

### Step 5: Check if Products are Listed in the Dashboard
After adding products to the `products` table, check if they are displayed correctly in your product dashboard.
