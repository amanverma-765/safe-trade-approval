The error `Syntax error: type "status" already exists` occurs because the `status` enum type is already defined in your database. To resolve this, you have a few options depending on your situation.

### Option 1: Check if the `status` type already exists
You can avoid trying to create the type again if it already exists by wrapping the `CREATE TYPE` statement with a check.

```sql
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_type WHERE typname = 'status') THEN
        CREATE TYPE status AS ENUM ('active', 'inactive', 'archived');
    END IF;
END $$;
```

This script will only create the type if it doesn't already exist, avoiding the error.

### Option 2: Drop and recreate the `status` type (only if you want to reset)
If you're okay with resetting the `status` type, you can drop it and recreate it. **Be cautious**, as this will remove the type and any dependencies that use it.

```sql
DROP TYPE IF EXISTS status CASCADE;
CREATE TYPE status AS ENUM ('active', 'inactive', 'archived');
```

The `CASCADE` option ensures that any objects (such as columns in your table) dependent on the type are also dropped, allowing you to recreate the type without issues.

### Option 3: Skip Creating the Type if Already Defined
If you're certain the `status` type exists and is correct, simply skip the `CREATE TYPE` command and proceed with creating the table using the existing type.

Proceed with just creating the `products` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  status status NOT NULL,
  price NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  stock INTEGER NOT NULL,
  available_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

### What to do:
- If you're sure the type already exists and it's what you want, proceed with **Option 3**.
- If you're modifying or resetting, use **Option 2**.
