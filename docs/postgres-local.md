To run your project locally and complete the setup, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
First, ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed.

1. Navigate to your project folder in the terminal.
2. Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Set Up PostgreSQL Locally
You can run PostgreSQL locally to match what Vercel Postgres would provide during production. If you don't have PostgreSQL installed locally, you can use the following methods:

1. **Install PostgreSQL** on your machine:
   - On macOS, you can use Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install postgresql
     ```
   - On Windows, you can use an installer from [PostgreSQL.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

2. Start the PostgreSQL service:
   ```bash
   pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start
   ```
   Or use this command if you're on macOS with Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew services start postgresql
   ```

### Step 3: Create the Database and Table Locally

1. Once PostgreSQL is running, connect to the local PostgreSQL instance:
   
   ```bash
   psql postgres
   ```

2. Create a new database for your application:
   
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE acme;
   ```

3. Connect to the new database:
   
   ```bash
   \c acme;
   ```

4. Create the `users` table as specified:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     name VARCHAR(255),
     username VARCHAR(255)
   );
   ```

5. Insert a test user:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO users (id, email, name, username) 
   VALUES (1, 'me@site.com', 'Me', 'username');
   ```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your local PostgreSQL configuration. Replace the `POSTGRES_URL` with your local connection string:

   ```env
   POSTGRES_URL=postgres://yourusername:yourpassword@localhost:5432/acme
   ```

Make sure to replace `yourusername` and `yourpassword` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

### Step 5: Run the Application Locally

1. Run the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the application and make it available on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 6: Seed the Database (Optional)

If you have a `seed.ts` file or an API to seed your database, uncomment it and run the seeding process:

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/seed` to seed the database, or use any other seed method defined in your project.

### Step 7: Access the Application Locally

Now, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the dashboard.

You should now be able to interact with your local version of the dashboard, see the `users` table populated, and manage products or other resources as required.

### Troubleshooting
- If the app doesn't start, ensure that the `POSTGRES_URL` and other environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- Check that your local PostgreSQL service is running.
- If any migration or seed scripts fail, ensure that the database is properly connected and the schema is up-to-date.
